We are all familiar with the paper deluge of the late 20C, but did you know that in the 18C there was a similar spike in the creation of paper records and that it was caused by the mass uptake of underwear? This gem (p. 75), and many others like it, can be discovered in *A History of Archival Practice*, Margaret Procter's revised and translated edition of Paul Delsalle's 1998 classic, *Une histoire de lâ€™archivistique*.

As its title indicates, this is *A History of Archival Practice*, rather than a history of archives, and it explores the different ways that archival functions have been performed through history and around the world. Delsalle's motivation for writing the book was to address what he saw as an 'identity crisis of the archival profession' (p. x). Some archivists he argued, see themselves as keepers of extant, static collections; others work actively with creators to negotiate transfers and then manage those records in custody; while yet others make a distinction between archives and records management (p. xi). Delsalle hoped to settle this argument by delving into the roots of the profession. As Procter puts it in her introduction, the work '[takes] the long view of the value of the archival role' (p. xv).

It is a long view, indeed. The work begins in the ancient world, moving quickly from cave art to clay tablets. The second chapter explores archival practices in the classical world, from the Greek city states to the Roman Empire. The next two chapters are scoped geographically: Asia and Africa; followed by the Americas. The following six chapters cover developments in Europe from the fifth to eighteenth centuries. These chapters intersperse chronological studies with treatments of particular themes, such as buildings and equipment, methods of arrangement, and the lives of medieaeval archivists. The final seven chapters explore archival practice in the modern age, covering topics such as legislation, the rise of the archives profession, and the development of professional societies and networks. 

The joy in reading this book is in encountering archival practices that resurface across the millenia, and that resonate with our work today. 

For example, one constant is the need to guarantee the authenticity of records. Seals were first used for this purpose thousands of years ago when clay tablets were the recordkeeping medium (p. 3). In the mediaeval period, chests with multiple locks were used to regulate access. The different keys would be placed in the charge of separate office bearers to ensure that no single person could alter the archive's contents. Delsalle gives numerous examples of these chests, including a seven lock version made in 1569 in Burgundy (p. 93). In Ancient Greece the archive - or *archeion* - itself had an authenticating function: records of private transactions were desposited into the State repository in order to validate those transactions (p. 19). 

Another constant is the practice of arranging and describing records to support their continuing use. While Delsalle disagrees with Ernst Posner's assertion that twelfth century BCE Ugarit was the first example of arrangement by fonds (p. 4), he does note very early sites like Ebla where records were kept in arrangments that reflected their business use (p. 3). Diverse methods of arrangements and description have been employed through the centuries. One of the strangest examples that Delsalle cites is Pierre de Balma's 1553 inventory that employed biblical and mythical names as codes. The town council's securities and mortgages were filed under 'Judas' (p. 152). The binding of records into volumes is a method of arrangement that pops up now and again through history, the best exemplar being the Korean dynastic histories (sillok): "life cycle management" - records created daily, summarised in chronicles (sillok), the daily records recycled. Multiple copies of the silloks kept in secure conditions. (p. 38)

Modest
"provisional, summary account" = rather than a universal account of archival practice
Proctor: "no chronological overview of archival practice over millenia"; "a framework for future research"
'existing periodicisations of archival practice now show themselves to be far too Eurocentric'. Admits work has a lot of gaps (p. 231)
Hopes for more sophisticated studies to follow, to become outdated (p. 232)
Tries to get out of Europe - Asia, Africa and the Americas included.

From a parochial perspective, Records Continuum theory earns a mention, the Australian Series System does not.

# Weaknesses

Teleological.

No evidence of an archival culture in Egypt - because don't keep records for long term reference (p. 8).
Romans didn't store records to support future use (p. 21) - this seems to be the benchmark
"The nature of archives and archival practice in China, as elsewhere in Africa and Asia, can often pose conceptual difficulties for those familiar with the Western tradition" (p 33)
Korean dynastic histories (sillok): "life cycle management" - records created daily, summarised in chronicles (sillok), the daily records recycled. Multiple copies of the silloks kept in secure conditions. (p. 38)
Griots of sub-Saharan Africa as oral records (p. 35)
Incan *quipucamayoc*: 'it would not be appropriate to call him an archivist' (p. 59). Created, interpreted and kept the quipus. 
Real archival practices developed in the abbeys and castles of Europe (p. 67).
Less of an archival tradition in the UK: 'State concerns about the maintenance of the archives were otherwise limited; records continued to be kept in their place of creation until space forced their storage in dozens of dispersed locations across London' (p. 122)

# More strengths

Treats:
repository of the Yellow Books in Nanjing during the Ming Dynasty (p. 35)
At the 1194 Battle of Freteval Richard I defeated Philip and captured the royal archives in the baggage train (p. 70)
Archive Simancas - 6 hours a day operation (daylight, no candles). Between 1583 and 1593 - 300 requests for copies. Charged 15 reales for a research fvisit (p. 110)
Pierre de Balma's inventory: biblical and mythical names for reference codes e.g. Judas for the town council's securities and mortgages (p. 152)
Jean Nicot - introduced tobacco to France was keeper of the archives of the French court from 1559 (p. 132)

"close relationship between archives and authority" (p. 102). they were kept as treasure in the centre of power
Until 19C throughout Europe access had overwhelmingly been for administrative, rather than research purposes (p. 144)
Arhives used to track feudal dues - *feudistes* a discrete profession who did research in archives (p. 139)
Procter's conclusion: motivation for archival management = rights maintained and accessible. used to be feudal, now restitution and reconciliation (p. 234)

Flawless translation
Bibliography - French language works replaced where possible with English language equivalents. Includes some recent research since 1998 publication. More examples of historical English practice - but French experience still dominates (a good corrective for anglophone privilege)
