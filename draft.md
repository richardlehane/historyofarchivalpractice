We are all familiar with the paper deluge of the late 20C, but did you know that in the 18C there was a similar spike in the creation of paper records and that it was caused by the mass uptake of underwear? This gem (p. 75), and many others like it, can be discovered in *A History of Archival Practice*, Margaret Procter's revised and translated version of Paul Delsalle's 1998 classic, *Une histoire de lâ€™archivistique*.

As its title indicates, this is *A History of Archival Practice*, rather than a history of archives, and it explores the different ways that archival functions have been performed through history and around the world. Delsalle's motivation for writing the book was to address what he saw as an 'identity crisis of the archival profession' (p. x). Some archivists he argued, saw themselves as keepers of extant, static collections; others worked actively with creating officers to negotiate transfers and then managed those records in custody; while yet others made a distinction between archives and records management (p. xi). Delsalle hoped to settle this argument by delving into the roots of the profession. As Procter puts it in her introduction, the work '[takes] the long view of the value of the archival role' (p. xv).

The gift.

Modest
"provisional, summary account" = rather than a universal account of archival practice
Proctor: "no chronological overview of archival practice over millenia"; "a framework for future research"
'existing periodicisations of archival practice now show themselves to be far too Eurocentric'. Admits work has a lot of gaps (p. 231)
Hopes for more sophisticated studies to follow, to become outdated (p. 232)
Tries to get out of Europe - Asia, Africa and the Americas included.
The first two chapters cover the Ancient and Classical worlds. The next two chapters are scoped geographically: Asia and Africa; followed by the Americas. The next 6 chapter
Begins in the Ancient World. Moves very quickly from cave art to earliest written records (clay tablets)
5000 clay tablets in king's palace at Ebla 3000 BCE found in original order. Relate to commerce and a small numer of decrees.
Then classical world: Greece and Rome.

Resonances with current recordkeeping issues. The very early use of seals in order to guarantee authenticity (p. 3).
Greek archeion - State repository used for deposit of private records and this validated those transactions (p. 19).
Same problems, different era. Republican Rome - complaints of officials keeping records privately and not making public records. Fragile media and forgery (p. 21)
Chests with multiple locks to regulate access. Such as the 7 lock chest made in 1569 at Beaune in Burgundy (p. 93)

No evidence of an archival culture in Egypt - because don't keep records for long term reference (p. 8).
Romans didn't store records to support future use (p. 21) - this seems to be the benchmark
"The nature of archives and archival practice in China, as elsewhere in Africa and Asia, can often pose conceptual difficulties for those familiar with the Western tradition" (p 33)
Korean dynastic histories (sillok): "life cycle management" - records created daily, summarised in chronicles (sillok), the daily records recycled. Multiple copies of the silloks kept in secure conditions. (p. 38)
Griots of sub-Saharan Africa as oral records (p. 35)
Incan *quipucamayoc*: 'it would not be appropriate to call him an archivist' (p. 59). Created, interpreted and kept the quipus. 
Real archival practices developed in the abbeys and castles of Europe (p. 67).
Less of an archival tradition in the UK: 'State concerns about the maintenance of the archives were otherwise limited; records continued to be kept in their place of creation until space forced their storage in dozens of dispersed locations across London' (p. 122)

Treats:
repository of the Yellow Books in Nanjing during the Ming Dynasty (p. 35)
At the 1194 Battle of Freteval Richard I defeated Philip and captured the royal archives in the baggage train (p. 70)
Archive Simancas - 6 hours a day operation (daylight, no candles). Between 1583 and 1593 - 300 requests for copies. Charged 15 reales for a research fvisit (p. 110)
Pierre de Balma's inventory: biblical and mythical names for reference codes e.g. Judas for the town council's securities and mortgages (p. 152)
Jean Nicot - introduced tobacco to France was keeper of the archives of the French court from 1559 (p. 132)

"close relationship between archives and authority" (p. 102). they were kept as treasure in the centre of power
Until 19C throughout Europe access had overwhelmingly been for administrative, rather than research purposes (p. 144)
Arhives used to track feudal dues - *feudistes* a discrete profession who did research in archives (p. 139)
Procter's conclusion: motivation for archival management = rights maintained and accessible. used to be feudal, now restitution and reconciliation (p. 234)

Flawless translation
Bibliography - French language works replaced where possible with English language equivalents. Includes some recent research since 1998 publication. More examples of historical English practice - but French experience still dominates (a good corrective for anglophone privilege)
